The system starts by secretly selecting a character from its database. It then presents the user with vague clues about the character. The user attempts to guess who it is. If the guess is incorrect, more hints are revealed. Once guessed correctly, the system reveals the character with celebratory feedback. Users can then choose to play again, starting the cycle anew.
